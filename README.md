#SMS Directions#

This is a simple app that allows users to text a number and receive directions from one address to another by text.

Here is what a typical message might look like:

```
walk from penn station, new york, ny
to grand central station, new york, ny
```

The application will return a list of directions, formatted in this style:

```
Head northeast on Pennsylvania Plaza toward W 33rd St(259 ft),
Turn right onto W 33rd St(0.4 mi),
Turn left onto 5th Ave(0.5 mi),
Turn right onto E 42nd St(0.2 mi).
```
